      Pickroom.app was installed to:
        #{opt_prefix}/Pickroom.app

      Put a real copy in Applications so Finder, Launchpad, and Spotlight see it:
        rm -rf /Applications/Pickroom.app
        cp -R #{opt_prefix}/Pickroom.app /Applications/Pickroom.app

      Repeat the copy after each upgrade, with Pickroom quit first.
